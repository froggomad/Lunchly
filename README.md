# Lunchly
#### Anyone with a lot of friends and/or colleagues knows what a pain it can be to agree on a lunch spot, and how unlikely it is that everyone will make it there on time. Busy professionals and social butterflys alike will appreciate Lunchly.

Schedule your lunches with friends and colleagues. Create groups to keep everything organized. Vote on your favorite lunch spots - the place with the most votes wins! Set a reminder, and Lunchly will let you know when it's time to leave so you're never late for lunch again!
